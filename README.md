# Refresher for Python and Postgres

I want to get back to coding. I learned Python ages ago, but whenever I try to get back to it my memory keeps fading. I want to use this repo to re-establish the foundations.

I will use this repo to learn Python and Postgres using the Udemy tutorial (and other resources).
I will aim to do a daily checkin as a way to keep the learning going. This will also make me comfortable with Git.

#readme-edits branch edits

I created a branch readme-edits under main, and am making changes to the README file in this branch.
